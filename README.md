# feed_the_dragon

Create a virtual environment-
```
conda create -n feed_the_dragon python=3.7
conda activate feed_the_dragon 
```
Once the virtual evironment is activated- `pip install pygame`

Feed the dragon as many coins as you can! Move the dragon UP or DOWN to get those coins. Watch out - coins get faster and faster the more the dragon eats!
